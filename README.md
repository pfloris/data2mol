# data2mol

This is a simple Python package which you can use to convert a LAMMPS data file to a LAMMPS molecule file.

# Usage
```
python data2mol
```
You will be prompted for the "style" (only full and molecular are available, for now) and the path of the data file you want to convert.
Please refer to the [LAMMPS Documentation](URL 'https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html') for further details on these formats and molecule styles.
